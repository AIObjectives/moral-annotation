[{"scenario": "I recently got my 1st job and I was super excited. I've been searching for a few months and I finally got hired by a local store. You know what they say, you should never be late to work, especially if it's your very first day of your very first job. The shop is about a half an hour walk from my house and I had to be there at 7:40 to open and prepare before 8 o'clock. I left my home around 7:10 to be extra sure I would arrive on time. After about 15 minutes I was on this really long uphill road when at the end of it I see someone on a bike going extremely fast. After about 4-5 seconds I heard a loud noise and turned my head around to see that he has crashed after, I imagine, going over a pothole. He must have been about 50 meters away from me by then. But my boss is really strict and upsetting him was the last thing I wanted on my first day.", "scenario_idx": 2, "choice": "I decide tostop to help and be late for work", "entities": "I,someone on a bike,my boss", "values": ["altruism", "compassion", "responsibility", "empathy", "integrity", "community", "respect for others", "punctuality", "professional responsibility", "self-interest"], "outcomes": ["I help the person who crashed on the bike.", "I arrive late to my first day of work.", "The person who crashed may receive necessary immediate assistance.", "My boss may be upset due to my tardiness.", "I may feel good about helping someone in need despite the potential consequences at work."]}]
