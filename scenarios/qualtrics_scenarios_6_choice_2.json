[{"scenario": "I met a girl on Tinder a couples of months ago, and after a while we had a date. We had a lot of fun and we connected instantly, but she wasn't interested in anything romantic. No big deal, we kept it to friendship (with sometimes things getting a little more physical, but rarely). We've gotten really close since, we text everyday, we see each other as much as possible, we've talked about a lot of really personal stuff. I thought I did a good job of moving on, that I wasn't interested in her that way anymore. Then, a couple of days ago I spent the night at her place. We drank a lot and it was getting late, so she offered me to stay to sleep, it's closer to my job anyway. We didn't have sex or anything, but we cuddled a lot, even though she's usually not a cuddler. The day after I had a hard time leaving, I've never felt so good in my life. That's when I realised that I was lying to myself, my feelings for her are clearly more than just friendship. But if I tell her how I feel, it might hurt the friendship. She has said that she feared to hurt me, she doesn't want me to feel bad because it's not gonna go further than that, so I kinda feel like an asshole for putting her in that situation.", "scenario_idx": 6, "choice": "I not say anything and potentially hurt our friendship", "entities": "I,girl", "outcomes": ["I continue to harbor unexpressed romantic feelings.", "I experience emotional discomfort or distress due to unrequited feelings.", "The friendship between me and the girl remains unchanged on the surface.", "I may struggle with feelings of resentment or sadness over time.", "The girl remains unaware of my true feelings, potentially leading to misunderstandings.", "I might miss the opportunity to potentially deepen the relationship, despite the risk involved.", "The dynamic of the friendship could become strained if my feelings intensify or become harder to hide."]}]
