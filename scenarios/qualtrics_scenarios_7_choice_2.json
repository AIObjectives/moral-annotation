[{"scenario": "My grandma is an addict with many vices, alcohol and gambling are the to main ones. When my mom was a kid my grandma would get drunk and be both verbally and physically abusive. Shortly after my mom turned 18 my grandma went to prison. She claimed to clean up her act and my mom forgave her and started sending her money. When I was a teen she spent the night at our place one night because she had no where else to go. While I was at school and my mom was at work she stole my life saving that I earned that summer working and she stole all of my moms jewelry. We later found out that she has stolen from just about everyone in the family as soon as they let her in. And she went back to jail for theft. She claims to have cleaned up her act again and my whole family has seemed to forgiven her. I haven't and I won't. I have zero respect for someone who will lie, steal, and beat their own family (especially their own child). So this year since it is the first year that I have my own place I wanted to throw a Christmas party for my family. Someone invited her without my knowledge and she arrives at my house.", "scenario_idx": 7, "choice": "I allow my grandmother to stay", "entities": "I,grandma,mom", "outcomes": ["Family members who have forgiven my grandmother feel validated in their decision to include her.", "I may experience discomfort or stress by having my grandmother at my home.", "My decision may lead to a temporary or superficial reconciliation with my grandmother.", "Other family members may view my decision as a sign of maturity or forgiveness.", "My grandmother gets an opportunity to interact with family members in a social setting."]}]
