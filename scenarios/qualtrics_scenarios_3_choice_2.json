[{"scenario": "About three weeks ago, my girlfriend was driving while I was a passenger. We were at a four way stop and if I'm being totally honest, I think she went when it wasn't her turn but it was really close and her car and the other guys hit each other at an angle so it was really hard to tell who was at fault. My girlfriend is about 3/4 African American but still somewhat light skinned. When we got out of the car, the other guy was an older man who was clearly agitated but as god as my witness I did not hear him say anything rude, let alone derogatory towards my girlfriend's race. He had called the police even before getting out of the car and I think it took them less than 10 minutes to get there. My girlfriend sat in her car calling her parents while the other guy and I did our best to redirect traffic around the two cars. When the police came up my girlfriend instantly went from calm and collected to tears streaming down her face when they asked her what happened she said that she saw the other guy look at her and then from her perspective hit her car on purpose. She also said that as soon as he got out of the car he started screaming at her things like \"this is why m*****'s shouldn't be behind the wheel and that she's an n-word who would be better in chains among other things. I was speechless and kept telling myself \"say something, just say something.", "scenario_idx": 3, "choice": "I say nothing", "entities": "I,my girlfriend,the other guy,the police", "outcomes": ["The police may initiate an investigation based on the girlfriend's claims of racial abuse.", "The girlfriend might face scrutiny or investigation for the car accident.", "The older man may face accusations of racial abuse and potentially legal consequences.", "I may experience guilt or regret for not speaking up.", "The relationship between me and my girlfriend could be strained due to my silence.", "The girlfriend's parents may become involved or concerned due to the incident and the claims made.", "The older man might feel wrongfully accused and defend himself against the allegations.", "Community or social media reactions could occur if the incident becomes public knowledge."]}]
