[{"scenario": "My grandma is an addict with many vices, alcohol and gambling are the to main ones. When my mom was a kid my grandma would get drunk and be both verbally and physically abusive. Shortly after my mom turned 18 my grandma went to prison. She claimed to clean up her act and my mom forgave her and started sending her money. When I was a teen she spent the night at our place one night because she had no where else to go. While I was at school and my mom was at work she stole my life saving that I earned that summer working and she stole all of my moms jewelry. We later found out that she has stolen from just about everyone in the family as soon as they let her in. And she went back to jail for theft. She claims to have cleaned up her act again and my whole family has seemed to forgiven her. I haven't and I won't. I have zero respect for someone who will lie, steal, and beat their own family (especially their own child). So this year since it is the first year that I have my own place I wanted to throw a Christmas party for my family. Someone invited her without my knowledge and she arrives at my house.", "scenario_idx": 7, "choice": "I ask my grandmother to leave the house", "entities": "I,grandma,mom", "outcomes": ["My grandmother feels rejected and possibly upset.", "Family members at the party may feel uncomfortable or divided over my decision.", "I feel a sense of control and boundary-setting in my own home.", "Some family members may support my decision, understanding my reasons.", "Other family members may criticize me for not forgiving my grandmother.", "My grandmother may miss the opportunity to reconnect with the family during the Christmas party.", "Tension or conflict may arise at the party following the incident."]}]
