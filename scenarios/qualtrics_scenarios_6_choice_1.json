[{"scenario": "I met a girl on Tinder a couples of months ago, and after a while we had a date. We had a lot of fun and we connected instantly, but she wasn't interested in anything romantic. No big deal, we kept it to friendship (with sometimes things getting a little more physical, but rarely). We've gotten really close since, we text everyday, we see each other as much as possible, we've talked about a lot of really personal stuff. I thought I did a good job of moving on, that I wasn't interested in her that way anymore. Then, a couple of days ago I spent the night at her place. We drank a lot and it was getting late, so she offered me to stay to sleep, it's closer to my job anyway. We didn't have sex or anything, but we cuddled a lot, even though she's usually not a cuddler. The day after I had a hard time leaving, I've never felt so good in my life. That's when I realised that I was lying to myself, my feelings for her are clearly more than just friendship. But if I tell her how I feel, it might hurt the friendship. She has said that she feared to hurt me, she doesn't want me to feel bad because it's not gonna go further than that, so I kinda feel like an asshole for putting her in that situation.", "scenario_idx": 6, "choice": "I write her a message telling her how I really feel", "entities": "I,girl", "outcomes": ["The girl understands my true feelings.", "The girl feels pressured or uncomfortable due to my confession.", "The friendship between me and the girl undergoes tension or awkwardness.", "I feel relieved for expressing my feelings.", "The girl reevaluates the nature of her relationship with me.", "I and the girl have a conversation about our relationship and boundaries."]}]
